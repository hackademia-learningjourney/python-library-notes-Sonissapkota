1. Pandas: Pandas is a software library written in python that is mainly used in the data manipulation
and data analysis. It offers various type sof function to manipualte and analysis of data making it 
easier to compute complex calculation

2. Numpy: Numpy is one of the popular python library especially used in the machine learning and AI. Unlike
pandas Numpy is used for processing multidimensional array and matrices. It has wide collection of high level
mathematical function for processing arrays and matrices.

3. Tensorflow: Tensorflow is an open source library particularly used in the machine learning and neural network
training. It was developed by google for its internal team for research and development later it was mad available 
to open source. Tensorflow can be usde to develop various kinds of model such as image recognition, natural langugae processing
and so on.

4. Keras: Keras is a open source python library that is used mainly used for implementing neural network. It is user
friendly, modular and extensible python library. However, currently is is integrated with tensorflow. On top of that Keras
allows user to produce deep models on smartphone, web and Java virtual machine. 

5. Sklearn: Sklearn also knonw as scikit learn is one of the most useful machine learning library written in python.
Sklearn provides lot of powerful machine learning tools such as classification, regression, clustering and dimensonality
reduction. 

6. Pytorch: Pytorch is one of such open source python library based on torch library developed by meta. Pytorch is primarily 
used for developing deep learning model which is mostly used in natural language processing and computer vision. The major 
advantage of using pytorch it excels in flexibility and ease of use.
